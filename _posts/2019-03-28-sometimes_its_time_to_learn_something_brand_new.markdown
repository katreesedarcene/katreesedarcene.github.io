I am not a writer. I am not a programmer......yet.  In December of 2018 I felt I was in a rut in life and was facing several personal challenges. A close friend of mine suggested I look into a coding course as she knows I am a geek at heart, love to learn and love challenges.  My profession up until this point has been a full time musician, singer, and composer. But sometimes in every industry things can peak in terms of growth, work and even enjoyment. Don't get me wrong I love music and still know I will be playing, performing and writing the rest of my life but it wasn't offering a new brain syntax. Sometimes you need a new brain syntax to motivate your whole body and life to be better, fearless, smarter, and exciting. I am not a biologist either so when I say I am creating new brain syntax, I can't prove that either except for the fact I have really had to concentrate and study coding unlike anything I've ever done since studying scale options with the legendary saxophonist George Coleman whose approach to the famous jazz standard "Giant Steps" gave me the "good headache". The new idea. The new brain syntax.  I am not 100% sure where this study and work is going to lead except I do believe that jumping in with an element of faith that nothing is loss from doing your best will land somewhere positive.
