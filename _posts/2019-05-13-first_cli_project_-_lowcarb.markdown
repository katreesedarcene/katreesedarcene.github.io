If you've ever been told you have to follow a particular diet the rest of your life, the first thing you think about are the things you can no longer eat. That was me with the ketogenic diet. Now it's a lifestyle but at first I had to sift through many recipes to get to the ones that have helped me commit to the change. So in my CLI project I thought I would introduce my 5 favorite Mexican low carb recipes.  I thought it would be best to keep it simple and straight forward for my first project as I am still not completely confident with beginner level coding. It took me almost a week  to get my project loading mainly because I still didn't know  things like the  difference between require and require relative and it's usage in the environment. I also  thought the program was being accessed through library files and not the bin directory.  Also from watching different tutorial videos I was combining  methods that did not work together. If I didn't have help sifting through them I think I would've spent another week on set up alone. 


I  found a website I felt was easier to scrape than others.  Not confusing in it's layout or too encrypted to protect their data. I probadly watched at least 4 tutorials on scraping and still had to reach out to a classmate on whether I was grabbing the right elements. Seems scraping is a big challenge for me and translating it to code.  I only used the web addresses and titles for each recipe.  In my project "Low Carb"    I structured the flow like this:

1. Welcomed the user
2. Gave them instruction to type in recipes
3. Pick a number to choose from those recipes
4. Access to a link
5. Gave instruction to type  in Adios to get the Hasta Luego message upon exit

Down the road there are things I would like to be able to tweak like instead of just accessing a link, I would want to go to the actual page. But still for a first project, it's  straight to the point and simple to understand not only for me but for anyone else new to coding.
